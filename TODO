trk data directory structure:

  - ~/.trk
    - config.yaml : Main config file, has project definitions
    - worklog/ : Directory for time tracking
      - project_1_log.csv
      - project_2_log.csv
    - invoices/ : Directory for invoices
      - project_1_invoices.yaml
      - project_2_invoices.yaml

Features/TODO

  - Come up with a better invoice storage format
    - One idea: yaml file per project with a list of invoices -- this matches how the log works.
    - Another: yaml file per invoice named based on the project + date period (invoice ID is hard)
    - Fields such as hourly rate and hours billed are optional since they can be inferred, but overridden
  - Invoices should show as dirty or something, when we've generated them but changed the hours.
    Then you should be able to regenerate an invoice, but if its marked as sent, throw warning.
  - Print invoice yaml location when written
  - Do not allow modification to hours for finalized invoice periods.
    - Warning for sent invoice periods
  - trk invoice list should only show generated invoices
    - but an option -a for 'all' should also show the current/pending invoice?
  - invoice periods:
   - monthly,
   - bimonthly
   - adhoc/rolling - arbitrary period, when you run `generate` it includes all days since the last invoice.

Issues

  - Date parsing issues
    - 3/5 doesnt work but 2024/3/5 does, we can probably try to just add this.
  - Error on incompatible flags
    - trk log -w --since
