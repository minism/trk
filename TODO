    - trk add starark 2 -m "Did some stuff": Log entry with note
    - trk set starark 4 --yesterday: Something like this, human readable, days ago, last week, explicit date, defaults to today
      - Output: 4 total
    - trk add starark 2 --yesterday
      - Output: 6 total (because it was an add)
    - trk clear starark: Clear the starark hours for today, could be reset instead

- Command ideas
  - trk log: By default just shows last 1-2 weeks
  - trk log -a: Show all, same as --since 1970
  - trk log -w: Group by week/project
  - trk log <project> or trk log -p <project> -- need to decide
    - trk log <project> matches trk add <project>
    - maybe just both though!
      - but then -p could be "group by project"
  


- TODOs
  - Trk log should print tables by week
