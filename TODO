- CLI structure

    - Writes, updates or removes time tracking entries

      - Output: 6 total
    - trk set tripsight 5: Re-write the hours of today to be 5 total?
    - trk add starark 2 -m "Did some stuff": Log entry with note
    - trk set starark 4 --yesterday: Something like this, human readable, days ago, last week, explicit date, defaults to today
      - Output: 4 total
    - trk add starark 2 --yesterday
      - Output: 6 total (because it was an add)
    - trk clear starark: Clear the starark hours for today, could be reset instead
  - trk log
    - Show a log of hours
      - Could be formatted like spreadsheet with different options, will need to play with this

- More command ideas

  - trk log: By default just shows last 30 days
  - trk log -a: Show all, same as --since 1970
  - trk log -w: Group by week/project
  - trk log -i: Group by invoice period / project (bimonthly)
  - trk log <project> or trk log -p <project> -- need to decide
    - trk log <project> matches trk add <project>
    - maybe just both though!
      - but then -p could be "group by project"

    Filter by -p, global command
