Features

  - Invoices should show as dirty or something, when we've generated them but changed the hours.
    Then you should be able to regenerate an invoice, but if its marked as sent, throw warning.
  - Print invoice yaml location when written

Issues
  
  - Date parsing issues
    - 3/5 doesnt work but 2024/3/5 does, we can probably try to just add this.
  - trk log --since "last week" uses sunday-based weeks, but trk log -w uses "Monday based weeks", can be fixed via offset though.
  - Error on incompatible flags
    - trk log -w --since
